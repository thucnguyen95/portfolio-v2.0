[h2]Project Details[/h2]
[p]The project was straightforward in its requirements and as an introduction to building a website, so the layout was fairly simple. This layout was reused for most of the pages, including the History, Neighborhoods, Art and Architecture, Must-See Sites, and the Food and Restaurants pages.[/p]
[br]

[h4]CSS[/h4]
[p]The pattern to laying out the elements was to either keep the image of interest on the left or right side of the page and the description on its opposite side. These blocks of content were visually divided by a border. As someone who was new to web development, I had not yet learned layouts such as flex or grid layouts, so the CSS part of the project was somehwat of a challenge.[/p]
[br]
[p]In order to get the outer div (enveloping the text and image content) to respect the height of its contents, the inner div which contained the image had its display property set to inline-block. This way, the outer div would respect the height of the image and its margins would expand. The two inner divs that contained the description and the image, respectively, were either floated to the left or to the right.[/p]
[br]
[p][b]Note:[/b] since this was my very first web development project, the media queries were not completed.[/p]

[p]The following shows the CSS pattern used for the pages with either the image of interest to the left of the text or to the right. The div surrounding the image adjusts to the image's height.[/p]
